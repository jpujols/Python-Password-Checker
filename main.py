We're using a while  loop here because we need to keep the program running until the user submits a password that satisfies all three conditions. Line 3 contains the three conditions connected with an and  operator. Line 3 becomes True  only when all three conditions are True . If that happens, Password is fine  is generated, and the break  statement will break the loop, and the program will stop. If at least one of the conditions in Line 3 is False Line 3 evaluates to False  and the print  statement under else is executed, and the loop starts over again.
